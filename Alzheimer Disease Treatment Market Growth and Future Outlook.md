According to recent studies, the global market size for Alzheimer’s treatment was estimated at approximately $4 billion in 2023. As the population aged 65 and older continues to rise, the demand for effective treatment options is expected to surge.

This growth can be attributed to ongoing advancements in drug development, including the emergence of novel biomarkers and treatment modalities, such as disease-modifying therapies that aim to slow disease progression.</p><p>One of the significant trends is the increasing investment in research and development.
